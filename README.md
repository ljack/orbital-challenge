Wanted to learn Three.js and saw https://reaktor.com/orbital-challenge/. Spent some nights hacking and got the puzzle solved. 

There're still some issues left. Feel free to look -around (the globe :-)

Started with static HTML and `<script>` tags. Ended up using yeoman, webpack and ES6 modules. Caused some issues, like using very old version of Three.js without realizing it.

It all starts from [app.js](src/js/app.js).
